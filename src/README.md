# An Engineer's Guide To Cerebral Palsy

Welcome to "The Engineer's Guide to Cerebral Palsy," a blog deeply personal, yet universally enlightening. I am the engineer Hi There.

I have been Living with Cerebral Palsy (CP) for nearly 40 years. I have a little secret I have no idea about what it is as what I means.

Now of course I know have CP, and I know for instance, Skiing is a terrible idea!

I've always been someone who has struggled with the concept of limitations, often pushing past my physical and emotional boundaries in an attempt to prove strength.

My inability to recognize or accept my own limitations has left me vulnerable, navigating through life with a mask of bravado and an unwavering belief in my invincibility.

This CP (Cerebral Palsy) has always been something I've managed to sidestep, choosing instead to focus on what my body could not do rather than embracing the potential it did possess.

It's a constant battle, one where I pretend to be more capable than my body allows simply because acknowledging the limitations imposed by CP would mean admitting defeat, and for me, that's something I refuse to do.

As the shadow that follows me everywhere chases my dreams, I've embarked on a journey to understand this condition and find ways to navigate it using the principles of engineering.

I am a seasoned Software Engineer with over two decades of experience in the technology industry, working extensively within various domains including frontend and backend development as well as DevOps. My journey began by mastering the intricacies of web technologies, which laid a strong foundation for me to explore and specialize in crafting seamless user experiences through frontend development.

My aim with this blog is to leverage the knowledge of software engineering and problem-solving skills, aiming to gain a deeper understanding and insight into my Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is a group of disorders that affect body movement and coordination, primarily caused by damage to the parts of brain. By applying my software engineering background, I plan on creating a user-friendly platform that helps me manage daily tasks more efficiently and provides valuable information about the condition. Through this blog, I aim to share my experiences, tips for daily living with CP and discuss technological advancements that can assist in overcoming the challenges associated with this condition. I believe by sharing my experiences, it will not only help me better understand CP but also contribute to the broader community's awareness and support for individuals with disabilities.

Cerebral palsy (CP) has been a shadow that's haunted me since my early days, affecting not just my physical abilities but also the way I perceive and interact with the world. Diagnosed at a young age, CP has been both an obstacle and a teacher in my life's journey.

Despite the challenges it presents, I see CP as an opportunity to innovate and share insights that might help others like me navigate their own paths.

As I struggle with the effects of aging on my physical abilities, navigating daily tasks has become increasingly difficult. This blog is a reflection of that struggle and an attempt to harness the problem-solving skills I've honed as an engineer. Here, you will find not just my personal experiences but also practical insights and strategies aimed at making life easier for others with CP.

Join me as I explore the intricacies of cerebral palsy through an engineering lens, and let's work together to redefine what it means to live with CP.

Onwards,
